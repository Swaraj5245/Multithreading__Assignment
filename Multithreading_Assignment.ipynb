    "\n",
    "1. Multithreading is most effective for tasks that can be parallelized. Some algorithms or processes may not benefit significantly from multithreading due to inherent sequential dependencies.\n",
    "2. Multithreading introduces additional overhead, such as the cost of context switching between threads. In some cases, the overhead may outweigh the benefits, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
